###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that padding, borders, and margins are very finicky! They tend to not play very nicely with certain other positioning CSS properties. Playing with padding, border, and margin can easily mess up any careful positioning you've done.

Aside from that, I learned that it's crucial to adjust these values to get a result that looks at all interesting or asthetically pleasing. I also learned that it's better practice to do a lot of padding and margins with em or percentage to optimize for scaling.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that positioning takes a lot of playing around with to get exactly right. Because the position of each element block affects one another (except with absolute positioning), you need to keep in mind what all of your other elements are doing, and where you want them to be. One other thing I learned is the versatility of position: relative, which allows for more precise positioning, while still affecting other elements (which wouldn't happen with position: absolute).

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest aspects of my design to implement were definitely stylistic changes to text. Applying fonts, colors, backgrounds, text shadow, and border radii are all perfectly straightforward to change and adjust.

The most difficult was without a doubt positioning of multiple different elements on the page, especially if you'd like to adjust them later on.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that it can often times be an exercise in frustration, and that things that seem like they should work fine may have conflicts with other element formatting. I also learned firsthand in this challenge the lesson from the 'Sensible CSS' video regarding automatic margins being in certain browsers (I'm lookin' at you, Chrome).

I also learned that you may need to fiddle with things a bit to get them exactly where you want, so in that sense, it taught me lessons in persistence. I know that all of the answers are in front of me, it's just a matter of making them work.

I think the biggest lesson that I learned from this challenge is the importance of pre-planning. Changing things on the fly after completing or nearly completing a site can quickly make a mess of things if you haven't thoroughly planned out your design and/or made your CSS extremely neat and efficient. I didn't use Atomic formatting in this challenge, but I'd like to try it in the future, as it seems much easier to adjust and understand.
