      <section class="blog">
        <p>Hey gang, today we're talking about something fun and interesting: <span class="bold">Classes</span>.</p>
        <p>First things first, what is a <span class="bold">class</span>? A class is simply an object in Ruby that acts as a template or blueprint to create other objects. That may seem a bit confusing, but it becomes easier to understand if you think about real-world object groups and what defines them. For instance, all TVs have a screen, power button, channel change, and volume adjustment. All of those things, especially the screen, are what define a television. Knowing that, we can easily make a program that replicates the things that we know are always true for a TV. Take a look at this example:</p>
        <div><img src="../imgs/Primitive%20TV%20Class.PNG"></div>
        <p>Well there we have it. That's a full class. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a thing for us at the moment. We have to tell it that we want it to act like a TV when we start it! To do that, we need what's known as an <span class="bold">initialize</span> method. Basically this does what it sounds like: it will set certain things about the object we're making to be true when we create a new one. Let's take a look:</p>
        <div><img src="../imgs/TV%20Class%20initialize.PNG"></div>
        <p>That's a bit better! What you see here is us telling the computer that when you create a new Television object, you specify the screen size, which gets saved in the <span class="bold">instance variable</span> for <code>@screen</code>. It also tells the computer that when we create a new Television object, the power will be off, the volume will be at 0, and the channel will start at 3. But this still doesn't do a whole lot for us yet. Those words with the little <code>@</code> symbols? Those guys are called <span class="bold">instance variables</span>. This is one of the things that allows classes to function in the first place. A variable, unless otherwise specified, is typically a <span class="bold">local</span> variable. This means it can't be carried from inside a method to outside one, or vice versa. An instance variable however, allows us to pass values across multiple methods. Cool, right? Let's add some more to our class to make it do more things:</p>
        <div><img src="../imgs/TV Class w Methods.PNG"></div>
        <p>There! It's <span class="bold">VERY</span> basic, but we've defined methods within the class that can act on the class object we create in order to do very specific things for us. In this example, we can now adjust the volume, change the channel, and turn the power off or on. Just like a real TV (of course it won't display anything)! So you can see from this example, the when we create a new Television object from this class, it'll start with certain attributes.</p>
        <p>Reviewing what I talked about in the first paragraph, what this program is doing, is allowing us to easily create a TV object which we then know has certain properties upon creation, and allows us to manipulate it in repeatable ways. Classes are powerful tools in Ruby, and you can create all sorts of interesting things using them.</p>
