      Hey everyone! So if this is all new to you, don't worry, it's definitely new for me too. I've never used any kind of version control or code storing (when would I need to!?). But I've learned so much in this first week already, and I'm excited to dig into more.

        The biggest concepts we delved into in our first course unit is the idea of **version control**.

        The key take away of version control is the fact that it's a method to keep you from screwing yourself over by introducing bugs or code that isn't ready, and overwriting all your previous hard work. It's basically a system of gating to make you slow down and not be a complete idiot.

        Not only that, but if you *were* to introduce a bug, version control allows you to go back to previous versions before you made any mistakes.

      Git is great at helping you keep track of all your changes, by letting you branch from the original project, and allowing you to go back and look through the log of all changes you've made. Not only that, but once you find the version of the file you want to go back to, it's easy to call up that version and start over from there.
    </p>

      GitHub is a prime method of storing code, mainly because it allows for *collaboration* and sharing of code. If you make something interesting, you can share it there, and let people take it further or improve it, and vise versa.
    </p>

      That's all I've got for now, guys, sorry. I'm sure these will get longer and more detailed as the weeks go on.
