    <p>So we've been working on writing programs for a couple months now, and we have a grasp on
    some intermediate coding concepts to make computers run through some relatively complex processes.
    But how does a computer work exactly? I've always been interested in computers and what they can do on the basic consumer level, but there were gaps in what I knew about how they actually functioned under the hood, even after building one myself. That's why I'm going to give a very basic overview of what's going on in the box right near you as you read this.</p>
    <p>Let's start with the most basic concepts. All computers consist of at least four things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="bold">Input</span> - This is what allows a user to communicate with the computer. When you type or click in order to give the computer a command, that is you operating the input. This can also be things like a microphone or camera. Anything that allows information to be passed into the computer is input.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Memory</span> - Your computer needs some way to store that information that's being passed in through the input or that you're currently working on. That's where the memory comes in, working somewhat similarly to the way your brain retains information, in both the short (RAM - which isn't retained when a computer is turned off) and long term (Hard drive - which will store information until it's erased).</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Processor</span> - This is what's furiously running through all the calculations given to the computer. When a program runs, it's communicating with the processor which computes whatever you're asking it to.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Output</span> - This is what communicates back out to the user (if there is one). This would be the display, printer, or speakers that can return information, much like how a user puts in information with the Input.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All of the components I've just described constitute parts of the <span class="bold">hardware</span>. These are solid, physical parts of the computer that, although they can be changed out, they will for the most part remain static throughout the life of the component. On the flipside, the programs and applications that run are refered to as the <span class="bold">software</span>. This is because programs are flexible and can be rewritten or changed on the fly.</p>
    <p>One of the most important pieces of software that your computer runs is the OS (Operating System). This is a piece of software that allows you to visually navigate your computer, as well as runs certain pieces of programming that are common to all computers. It's what most other programs you might install on your computer run on top of, and it's why certain programs only work on Mac or Windows machines.</p>
    <p>A debatably <b>more</b> important piece of software is the BIOS (Basic Input Output System), which, as it sounds, is in charge of linking anything used to communicate between the user and the computer (the same input and output discussed earlier.</p>
    <p>Now that we understand the basic hardware components of a computer, and the most fundamental pieces of software, we can discuss the main structure of a computer. All of the components that I've mentioned work in concert, but are built on one another. At the very base foundation is the hardware. A computer would not exist without its hardware. Next comes the BIOS, because it would be impossible to interact with the computer and ask it to do anything for us without this software, and what good would a non-interactive computer be? On top of those two parts, comes the Operating System, which handles the way that programs and other aspects of the computer run, which is where the Applications are built. All of that together makes up the computer that you're currently using.</p>
    <p>Now how does a computer actually do the computing? Well the processor works with a series of switches that correspond to 1s and 0s called binary when switched on or off (1 for on, 0 for off). This binary code is the language that computers speak, and the programs we write are ultimately translated by what's known as a compiler to binary, allowing the computer to read and respond to our input.</p>
    <p>And that is a very high-level view of the components of a computer and how they work together to function the way that we're all familiar with.</p>
