	<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
		
		 I was navigating on this pairing. It was a little difficult to describe what I had in mind while he was the one doing the actual creating, but it got easier as we grew accustomed to the process. 

		-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

		Now that I had a better idea of a goal in mind (a blog page as opposed to just a "personal website"), with an end product better served by simple html text, it was much more helpful to the design process.

		-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

		We decided to work with a wireframe of elements that we knew we could create with basic HTML. We also wanted to design the wireframe with change in mind, because we're aware that learning CSS will definitely inspire us and lead us to drastically alter our respective sites. 

		-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

		We mostly used elements that we were already familiar with, but what we did learn about is certain attributes. The attributes we learned about were image alignment and width/height.
