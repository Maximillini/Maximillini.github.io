			<p class="body">Hi! My name is Max Iniguez. I grew up just west of Chicago in a small town called Geneva. I studied English at the University of Illinois. While I love literature and history, it proved to be difficult to find a job in those fields, especially in 2008 when I graduated (directly into the biggest recession in decades). I had begun to consider law school as an option, and after a few years of working my way to a full-time job in the Legal Department at a tech company, I felt like I was on my way. But two years went by, and instead of feeling motivated and inspired to continue on to law school, I found myself bored and stagnant. I had to some thinking to do. When I had a project to work on in collaboration with part of our Engineering Department, things suddenly started to click. I was excited and interested for the first time in a while, and I knew why. I always loved computers, and I realized that what I really wanted to do was build something. I had built little games and things using primitive programming as a kid, and was still messing around with Codeacademy on my own. It all made sense at that point, that coding is something I could feel passionate about. That's when I started taking steps to attend Dev Bootcamp, looking to make a change in my life for the better.</p>
			<div class="body">I've always been a gamer, whether videogames, board games, or sports, so I live on my computer most of the time. I also am a big movie buff, and when I'm not on my computer, you can generally find me at the <a href="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/">Music Box Theater</a> on Southport. I love all things weird, scary, and funny in movies.</div>
			<div class="body">...I also play the sousaphone.</div>
